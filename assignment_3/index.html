                  Law is a system of rules and regulations that are put in place to govern and regulate the behavior of
                  individuals and organizations within a society. It serves as a framework for the functioning of
                  society, ensuring that everyone is treated fairly and that conflicts are resolved in a peaceful and
                  orderly manner. <br>

                  There are two main types of law: criminal law and civil law. Criminal law deals with cases where an
                  individual is accused of committing a crime, such as murder or theft. Civil law, on the other hand,
                  deals with disputes between individuals or organizations, such as contract disputes or personal injury
                  cases. <br>

                  The legal system in the United States is divided into federal and state levels. Federal law applies to
                  the entire country and is created by the United States Congress, while state law applies only to the
                  specific state and is created by the state legislature. <br>

                  The process of creating and enforcing laws is a complex one. Laws are first proposed by elected
                  representatives, such as members of Congress or state legislators. These proposals are then debated
                  and, if passed, become laws. Once a law is in place, it is enforced by law enforcement agencies, such
                  as the police and FBI. If an individual or organization breaks a law, they may be charged with a crime
                  and go through a criminal trial. If found guilty, they may face punishment such as fines,
                  imprisonment, or both. <br>

                  The legal system also includes a system of courts and judges. These individuals are responsible for
                  interpreting the law and making decisions in legal cases. The highest court in the United States is
                  the Supreme Court, which is made up of nine justices who are appointed by the President and confirmed
                  by the Senate. <br>

                  One of the most important principles of the legal system is the concept of due process. This means
                  that everyone has the right to a fair and impartial trial. This includes the right to a lawyer, the
                  right to a fair and impartial jury, and the right to present evidence in one's defense.

                  Another important principle of the legal system is the principle of equality under the law. This means
                  that everyone is subject to the same laws and that no one is above the law. <br>

                  The legal system plays a crucial role in maintaining order and protecting the rights of individuals
                  within a society. It is a complex and constantly evolving system that requires the participation and
                  cooperation of all members of society. <br>

                  In conclusion, Law is an essential part of any society, serving as a framework to govern and regulate
                  the behavior of individuals and organizations. It is divided into criminal and civil law, and is
                  enforced by law enforcement agencies, courts, and judges. The principles of due process and equality
                  under the law are crucial to the functioning of the legal system and ensure that everyone is treated
                  fairly and that conflicts are resolved in a peaceful and orderly manner. <br>

                HTML Semantic tags indicate what the content is rather than just how the browser displays them.By using
                Semantic tags in our code, we can provide additional information about that document by defining the
                layout and sections of the webpage.A semantic element clearly describes its meaning to both the browser
                and the developer. Examples of non-semantic elements: &lt;div> and &lt;span> - Tells nothing about its
                content. Examples of semantic elements: &lt;form> , &lt;table> , and &lt;article> - Clearly defines its

                Media queries in CSS allow you to apply styles based on the characteristics of the device or screen
                displaying the webpage. This enables a responsive design, where the layout and styles of the webpage
                adapt to the screen size and device type. Media queries use CSS selectors to target specific styles to
                different screen sizes, resolutions, orientations, and other characteristics. This allows for a seamless
                user experience across different devices, such as desktop computers, tablets, and smartphones. Media
                queries are used to create a responsive design, where the layout and styles of the webpage adapt to the

                The CSS box model is a layout concept that describes how the dimensions of an HTML element are
                calculated. It defines the space that an element takes up on a web page, and how that space is divided
                between the element's content, padding, borders, and margins.

                Each HTML element is considered a rectangular box, and the box model defines how the element's content,
                padding, borders, and margins are calculated. The content area of the box is where the element's actual
                content (like text, images, etc.) is displayed. Surrounding this content area, there's the padding,
                which separates the content from the border. The border surrounds the padding and separates the element
                from other elements on the page. Finally, the margin is the space outside the border that separates the
                element from other elements.

                When calculating the dimensions of an element, the browser starts with the content width and height, and
                then adds the padding, border, and margin. The total size of an element is the sum of all of these
                values. For example, if you set the width of an element to be 100px and add 10px of padding and a 2px
                border, the total width of the element will be 124px.

                It's important to note that the box-sizing property can change the way the box model works. By default,
                the box-sizing is set to content-box, which means the box model calculates the width and height of an
                element based on the content, padding, and border. But it can be changed to border-box, that means the
                width and height properties include the content, padding, and border, not just the content.

                Flexbox and Grid are both CSS layout modules that are used to create flexible and responsive layouts.

                Flexbox is primarily used for one-dimensional layout, and is best suited for items that are arranged in
                a single row or column. It helps align items along a single axis and distribute space between them.
                Flexbox is useful for creating things like navigation bars, and is generally easier to use for simple
                layout tasks.

                Grid, on the other hand, is a two-dimensional layout system that allows items to be arranged in rows and
                columns. It is best suited for more complex layout tasks, such as creating a grid of items with varying
                sizes and proportions. Grid provides more control over layout, and allows for more precise alignment of
                items. It is also useful for creating responsive designs, as items can be easily rearranged based on
                screen size.

                In summary, Flexbox is useful for creating a one-dimensional layout, while Grid is useful for creating a
                two-dimensional layout, with more control and precision. They can be used together to create a more
                complex layout.
